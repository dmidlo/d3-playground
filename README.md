# d3-playground

This playground is set up to learn just enough D3 to create a javascript graph generator that is able to make list of drawings of all the graphs with N vertices and E edges for all N,E with N + E <= X, where X = 6.  This generator should not include any isomorphic pairs of graphs and should be able to determine which of the generated graphs are simple. 

*for X=6 there should be a total of 65 graphs, of which 14 are simple*
